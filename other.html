        <p class="About">
            My name is David Lutman and I am a 23-year-old programmer from Vancouver, Canada. 
            I originally grew up in North Vancouver where I lived until I went to university. 
            One I began my post-secondary studies at the University of British Columbia, I moved onto campus. 
            At University I tried to get involved with as many things as possible. 
            I joined a fraternity and got involved with as many recreation sports as my schedule would allow it. 
            I was originally drawn to Computer Science because I had always enjoyed problem solving as I grew up. 
            When I took the intro Computer Science course, I knew immediately that this was the field that I wanted to devote my university experience to learning more about. 
            Computer science allowed me to solve problems in more than just one way, which I really valued as it felt less rigid than I had previously experience throughout my schooling. 
            Outside of programming I tend to spend my time playing recreation soccer and basketball, playing video games with my friends, and reading fantasy or science fiction novels.
             Another big passion of mine is travelling, I have gone on multiple road trips down the west coast of the United States of America, as well as having visited islands in the Caribbean and Japan. 
             I hope to continue travelling as I age and exploring more areas of the world so that I can learn and experience more of what the world has to offer.
